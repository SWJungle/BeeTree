1) Start at the root and go up to leaf node containing the key K
2) Find the node n on the path from the root to the leaf node containing K
    A. If n is root, remove K
         a. if root has mode than one keys, done
         b. if root has only K
            i) if any of its child node can lend a node
               Borrow key from the child and adjust child links
            ii) Otherwise merge the children nodes it will be new root
    B. If n is a internal node, remove K
        i) If n has at lease ceil(m/2) keys, done!
        ii) If n has less than ceil(m/2) keys,
            If a sibling can lend a key,
            Borrow key from the sibling and adjust keys in n and the parent node
                Adjust child links
            Else
                Merge n with its sibling
                Adjust child links
    C. If n is a leaf node, remove K
        i) If n has at least ceil(M/2) elements, done!
            In case the smallest key is deleted, push up the next key
        ii) If n has less than ceil(m/2) elements
        If the sibling can lend a key
            Borrow key from a sibling and adjust keys in n and its parent node
        Else
            Merge n and its sibling
            Adjust keys in the parent node
